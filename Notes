--Differences Between Firebase and Firestore 
--->Firebase is Google’s app development platform. It includes a vast range of products and features that allow developers to create apps fast without managing the infrastructure.
Firestore is one of the two databases available at Firebase. It’s a new and improved version of the Real-Time Database, and its capabilities include real-time updates, offline synchronization, scalability, and multi-region deployment.

--Compat - a familiar API surface which is fully compatible with the version 8 SDK, allowing you to upgrade to version 9 without changing all of your Firebase code at once. Compat libraries have little to no size or performance advantages over their version 8 counterparts.
// v9 compat packages are API compatible with v8 code
import firebase from 'firebase/compat/app';
import 'firebase/compat/auth';
import 'firebase/compat/firestore';
